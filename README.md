# My-First-Subtractive-Synth
Subtractive Synth using max/msp
# Description
This is a subtractive synth software instrument building using Max/MSP. I used Prophet-5 from Sequential as my reference to implement different sections in this synth. This subtractive synth contains two oscillators A&B: VCO, Filter envelop, Mono LFO, Poly LFO, VCA envelop and mod wheel modulation.
